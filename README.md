# p5.js template

This code is a “starter kit” for using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) with a sketch
written as a [JavaScript
module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

"Event" functions, that [p5.js documents](https://p5js.org/reference/) but that
are defined in the sketch, must be prefixed by `export` in order to be visible
to p5.js. For example, `export function setup()` and `export function draw()` in
the starter code.

## History

It was first used for the [p5.js particle
workshop](https://www.notion.so/P5-js-Particle-Workshop-aba7992a689c457a8cca10e2f49e6a04)
in the Fall 2019 Movement Practices course.

I recieved help from various sources with my code, primarily through the Movement Practice Class Professors. As well, I recieved help from Cara with figuring out my IMU orientation. In terms of other aspeccts of my code and animations, I did these parts on my own. 
The musical track in my project was composed/produced by me, and the water noises were taken from Freesound.org
